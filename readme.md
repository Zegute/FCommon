<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

When making the project
[Cubecraft](https://github.com/FlyBirdGameStudio/Cubecraft),
I found that I need some special but useful things,
that I can not find on normal libraries,
so that is why I create this tool set.
It is basically just simple utility classes for math,register,query,logging...
and more things you can find here.Go ahead and try it.
